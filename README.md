PolkaStart Wallet is an Android mobile app where users can explore real Polkadot wallet features in a simulated environment. Users can learn, explore and get started with Polkadot ecosystem in a safe and risk-free way.

*Note*

The wallet is in an early stage of development. It currently supports the ed25519 key type to simplify onboarding and development. Support for sr25519 will be added in the future when more advanced use cases emerge and require this.
